# L.A.F.R.E.S. – Lithium Acoustic Fusion Reactor for Energy Sustainability

## Mission Statement

Develop a research-grade architecture for a compact neutron-generating system using:

- **Liquid-lithium blanket** for neutron moderation and heat capture
- **Acoustic stabilization** for surface control and shock damping
- **Pulsed micro-fusion** (non-break-even) for controlled neutron generation
- **Thermoelectric heat extraction** for energy conversion
- **AI-based control** for system optimization and safety

**Important:** This project is **not intended for grid power**—it is designed for R&D and materials testing only. This is a research-grade blueprint without claiming operational fusion power generation.

## Project Overview

L.A.F.R.E.S. is a fully documented, research-grade conceptual design for a lithium-acoustic micro-fusion system. The project aims to create a comprehensive technical blueprint that explores the theoretical integration of multiple advanced technologies for controlled neutron generation and thermal management.

### Key Objectives

2. **Thermal Management**: Efficient heat capture and conversion using liquid lithium blanket
3. **Acoustic Control**: Advanced stabilization and damping using multi-frequency transducer arrays
4. **Safety First**: Comprehensive safety protocols and emergency systems
5. **Research Documentation**: Full simulation suite and experimental validation pathways
