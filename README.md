## Mission Statement

Develop a research-grade architecture for a compact neutron-generating system using:

- **Liquid-lithium blanket** for neutron moderation and heat capture
- **Acoustic stabilization** for surface control and shock damping
- **Pulsed micro-fusion** (non-break-even) for controlled neutron generation
- **Thermoelectric heat extraction** for energy conversion
- **AI-based control** for system optimization and safety

**Important:** This project is **not intended for grid power**—it is designed for R&D and materials testing only. This is a research-grade blueprint without claiming operational fusion power generation.

## Project Overview

L.A.F.R.E.S. is a fully documented, research-grade conceptual design for a lithium-acoustic micro-fusion system. The project aims to create a comprehensive technical blueprint that explores the theoretical integration of multiple advanced technologies for controlled neutron generation and thermal management.

### Key Objectives

1. **Neutron Generation**: Controlled neutron flux (10^6–10^10 n/s in lab mode) using pulsed micro-fusion
2. **Thermal Management**: Efficient heat capture and conversion using liquid lithium blanket
3. **Acoustic Control**: Advanced stabilization and damping using multi-frequency transducer arrays
4. **Safety First**: Comprehensive safety protocols and emergency systems
5. **Research Documentation**: Full simulation suite and experimental validation pathways

## Safety & Regulatory Compliance

This project acknowledges significant safety and regulatory requirements:

- **Lithium handling**: Fire suppression, inert atmosphere protocols
- **Radiation safety**: Shielding design, monitoring, ALARA principles
- **Tritium management**: Simulation only; actual handling requires licensed facility
- **Emergency systems**: Automatic shutdown, inert gas purge, thermal runaway prevention

---

## Contributing

- Maintain scientific rigor
- Include proper citations
- Address safety considerations
- Document assumptions clearly

---

## Disclaimer

This project is a **theoretical research blueprint**. It does not claim to produce net-positive fusion energy. Any practical implementation would require:

- Extensive peer review
- Regulatory approval
- Licensed facility
- Qualified personnel
- Significant funding
