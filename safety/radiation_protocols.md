# Radiation Safety Protocols

## 1. Radiation Sources

- **Neutrons**: 2.45 MeV (D-D) or 14.1 MeV (D-T), 10⁶-10⁹ n/s
- **Gamma rays**: From neutron capture reactions
- **X-rays**: From high voltage (30-100 kV) electron impacts
- **Activation**: Induced radioactivity in structural materials

## 2. Shielding

**Primary**: Liquid lithium blanket (10-20 cm) → reduces fast neutron flux by factor of 10-100

**Secondary**: Polyethylene or borated materials (50-100 cm) → thermalize and absorb neutrons

**Gamma/X-ray**: Lead sheet (5-10 mm) around HV feedthroughs and chamber

## 3. ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)

**Time**: Minimize exposure duration  
**Distance**: Maximize distance from source (inverse square law)  
**Shielding**: Use all available shielding

## 4. Monitoring

**Area Monitors**: Neutron rem counters at 4 positions (N, S, E, W), continuous, alarm at >2 μSv/hr above background

**Personal Dosimetry**: All personnel wear electronic dosimeters (EPD), monthly/quarterly readout

**Surveys**: Weekly with portable meters (neutron + gamma)

## 5. Dose Limits

**Occupational**: 20 mSv/year (averaged over 5 years, max 50 mSv in single year) - ICRP  
**Public**: 1 mSv/year (at facility boundary)

**L.A.F.R.E.S. Target**: <5 mSv/year for workers, <0.1 mSv/year at boundary

## 6. Access Control

**Radiation Area** (>0.05 mSv/hr): Posted, access logged  
**High Radiation Area** (>1 mSv/hr): Locked when unoccupied, alarmed  
**Operation**: No entry when fusion core is operating (enforced by interlocks)

## 7. Emergency Response

**High radiation alarm**: Evacuate, notify RSO, survey with portable meters

**Contamination**: Remove clothing, wash with soap and water, re-survey

## 8. Waste Management

**Activated components**: Store for decay (weeks-months), dispose as LLRW through licensed contractor

## 9. Training

**Required**: 4-hour radiation safety course, annual refresher

**Instructor**: Certified health physicist (CHP) or RSO
