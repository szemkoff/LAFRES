# Cost Estimates Summary

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | Equipment | Personnel | Other | Total (Low) | Total (High) |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Phase 0: Simulation** | 6-12 mo | $15K | $100K | $10K | $125K | $250K |
| **Phase 1: Lithium Bench** | 12-18 mo | $260K | $300K | $50K | $730K | $1.84M |
| **Phase 2: Neutron Coupling** | 12-18 mo | $200K | $300K | $50K | $550K | $1.4M |
| **Phase 3: Micro-Fusion** | 18-24 mo | $115K | $450K | $70K | $700K | $1.27M |
| **Contingency (20%)** | — | — | — | — | $400K | $950K |
| **TOTAL** | 5-6 years | $590K | $1.15M | $180K | **$2.5M** | **$5.7M** |

**Midpoint Estimate**: ~$4M

## Detailed Cost Categories

### Equipment ($590K-$1.92M)
- Lithium containment vessel: $50K-$150K
- Lithium (enriched): $15K-$100K
- Acoustic transducers + electronics: $40K-$170K
- Thermoelectric modules + cooling: $30K-$110K
- Fusion core components: $65K-$185K
- Neutron detectors: $20K-$80K
- External neutron source: $100K-$500K (Phase 2)
- Control system hardware: $45K-$120K
- Instrumentation: $30K-$80K
- Shielding materials: $50K-$200K
- Vacuum systems, gas handling: $20K-$50K
- Miscellaneous (tools, supplies): $25K-$75K

### Personnel ($1.15M-$2.37M)
**Roles and Approximate Effort**:
- Nuclear engineer: 3-4 FTE-years × $80K-$120K = $240K-$480K
- Mechanical engineer: 2-3 FTE-years × $70K-$100K = $140K-$300K
- Electrical/control engineer: 2-3 FTE-years × $75K-$110K = $150K-$330K
- Physicist (plasma/neutronics): 2-3 FTE-years × $80K-$120K = $160K-$360K
- Technicians: 3-5 FTE-years × $50K-$70K = $150K-$350K
- Safety specialist (part-time): 1-2 FTE-years × $90K-$130K = $90K-$260K
- Project manager (part-time): 1-2 FTE-years × $100K-$150K = $100K-$300K
- **Total**: 14-21 FTE-years → $1.03M-$2.38M

**Note**: If conducted at university, grad student/postdoc labor costs lower ($30K-$60K/year)

### Other Costs ($180K-$505K)
- Software licenses (MCNP, COMSOL, ANSYS): $10K-$30K
- Computing (HPC, cloud): $5K-$15K
- Licensing and regulatory consulting: $50K-$150K
- Facility modifications (ventilation, power, space rental): $50K-$200K
- Travel (conferences, vendor visits): $15K-$40K
- Publications and outreach: $10K-$20K
- Insurance: $20K-$50K
- Training (safety courses, certifications): $10K-$30K
- Utilities (electricity, cooling water, gases): $10K-$40K
- Contingency (20% of total): Included separately

## Funding Strategies

### Government Grants
- **DOE ARPA-E**: Transformative energy technologies ($1M-$10M awards)
- **DOE SBIR/STTR**: Small business innovation ($150K-$1.5M)
- **NSF**: Fundamental research ($300K-$1M per year, 3-year projects)
- **NNSA**: Nonproliferation, forensics applications (if neutron source focus)

### Private/Industry
- **Venture capital**: If commercialization angle (neutron source for industry)
- **Strategic partners**: Utilities, national labs, defense contractors
- **Philanthropic**: Breakthrough Energy, Schmidt Futures (high-risk, high-reward)

### Academic
- **University cost-sharing**: Facilities, overhead reduction
- **Student labor**: Ph.D. students (lower cost, longer timeline)

## Cost Reduction Opportunities

1. **Partner with existing facility**: Use university reactor or national lab (eliminates some equipment costs)
2. **Commercial neutron source (Phase 2)**: Rent instead of purchase ($20K-$50K/year)
3. **Open-source software**: OpenFOAM, OpenMC instead of commercial (save $10K-$30K)
4. **Incremental funding**: Secure Phase 0-1 funding first, use results to attract Phase 2-3 funding
5. **In-kind contributions**: Equipment loans, donated labor (advisors, consultants)

## Cost Escalation Risks

- **Material price volatility**: Lithium, tungsten, rare earth (TE materials)
- **Regulatory delays**: Extended timeline → higher personnel costs
- **Scope creep**: Additional experiments, design iterations
- **Equipment failures**: Replacement costs not fully covered by contingency

**Mitigation**: Phased funding, realistic contingency (20%), rigorous project management
