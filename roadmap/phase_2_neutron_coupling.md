# Phase 2: Neutron Coupling (External Neutron Source)

## Duration
12-18 months

## Objectives
Test lithium blanket response to neutron irradiation using EXTERNAL neutron source (not integrated fusion core). Validate neutron transport and thermal coupling.

## Neutron Source Options

### Option A: Commercial D-T Generator
- **Example**: Thermo Fisher P385 or NSD Fusion Gradel
- **Yield**: 10⁸-10¹⁰ n/s
- **Energy**: 14.1 MeV (D-T)
- **Advantage**: Pre-licensed, turn-key
- **Disadvantage**: Fixed geometry, expensive ($100K-$500K)

### Option B: Radioisotope Source
- **Example**: Am-Be or Cf-252
- **Yield**: 10⁶-10⁷ n/s (typical capsule)
- **Energy**: Broad spectrum (0-11 MeV)
- **Advantage**: No power required, simple
- **Disadvantage**: Lower yield, disposal challenges

### Option C: University Reactor Beamport
- **Example**: TRIGA or pool reactor
- **Yield**: Adjustable, up to 10¹²-10¹⁴ n/cm²/s (flux)
- **Advantage**: High flux, established facility
- **Disadvantage**: Must transport lithium system to reactor site

**Baseline**: Option A (commercial D-T generator)

## Tasks

**Months 0-6: Licensing and Integration**
- Submit radiation license application (or amendment to existing)
- Regulatory review (~6 months)
- Design neutron source mounting and collimation
- Procure neutron detectors and additional shielding

**Months 6-12: Installation and Testing**
- Install external neutron source near lithium blanket
- Calibrate neutron detectors
- Characterize neutron field (flux mapping)

**Months 12-18: Coupled Experiments**
1. **Neutron thermalization**: Measure fast/thermal flux ratio, compare to MCNP
2. **Heating**: Measure lithium temperature rise vs. neutron rate
3. **Tritium breeding** (if ⁶Li present): Calculate vs. measure (via activation analysis)
4. **Acoustic response**: Does neutron pulsing (if available) couple to acoustic modes?
5. **TE performance**: Power output correlated with neutron-induced heating

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Radiation license approved
- [ ] Measured neutron flux within ±30% of MCNP prediction
- [ ] Measured heating rate within ±20% of calculation
- [ ] Safe operation (dose rates at boundary <0.1 mSv/hr)

## Budget
**Neutron source** (purchase or lease): $100K-$500K  
**Shielding upgrades**: $50K-$150K  
**Detectors and instrumentation**: $50K-$100K  
**Personnel**: $300K-$500K  
**Licensing and consulting**: $50K-$150K  
**Total**: $550K-$1.4M

## Risks
- Regulatory delays (license approval >1 year)
- Neutron source availability/cost
- Integration challenges (geometry mismatch)

## Mitigation
- Start license application early (during Phase 1)
- Alternative: Partner with national lab or university with existing license
