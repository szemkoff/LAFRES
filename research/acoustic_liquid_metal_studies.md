# Acoustic Studies in Liquid Metals

## 1. Introduction

Application of acoustic fields to liquid metals is relatively unexplored, especially at high temperatures relevant to fusion blankets.

## 2. Relevant Literature

### 2.1 Ultrasonic Cavitation in Liquid Metals
- **Eskin & Eskin (2015)**: *Ultrasonic Treatment of Light Alloy Melts*
- **Application**: Grain refinement, degassing in aluminum casting
- **Frequency**: 15-25 kHz (lower than L.A.F.R.E.S.)
- **Finding**: Cavitation threshold in liquid aluminum ~1-2 MPa

### 2.2 Acoustic Levitation
- **Foresti et al. (2013)**: "Acoustic levitation of soap bubbles in air"
- **Xie & Wei (2001)**: "Parametric study of acoustic levitation"
- **Relevance**: Radiation pressure can levitate objects; applicable to surface control

### 2.3 Liquid Metal MHD-Acoustic Coupling
- **Literature Gap**: Very few studies on acoustic waves in electrically conducting fluids with magnetic fields
- **Theory**: Alfvén waves (magnetoacoustic) may couple to ultrasonic modes

## 3. Expected Phenomena in L.A.F.R.E.S.

### 3.1 Radiation Pressure
- Formula: P_rad = E_acoustic / c_sound
- For 1 MPa amplitude: P_rad ~ 0.05 MPa (5% of acoustic pressure)
- **Effect**: Can counteract gravity or disturbances on lithium surface

### 3.2 Acoustic Streaming
- Nonlinear effect: Steady flow induced by acoustic absorption
- Velocity scale: v ~ (α λ) v_acoustic²
- For lithium: Low absorption α → weak streaming (but still measurable)

### 3.3 Temperature Effects
- Sound speed in lithium: c(T) ≈ 4600 - 0.5×T (m/s, T in °C, rough approximation)
- At 400°C: c ~ 4400 m/s
- Implications: Acoustic resonances shift with temperature (must account for in control)

## 4. Experimental Validation (Planned)

### Phase 1 Tests
1. **Frequency sweep**: Identify cavity modes, compare to FE simulation
2. **Surface displacement**: Measure with capacitive sensors, correlate with acoustic pressure
3. **Impulse response**: Apply mechanical disturbance, measure decay rate with/without acoustic control

### Expected Results
- Mode frequencies within ±5% of simulation
- Surface damping >60% (compared to passive)

## 5. Novel Contributions

L.A.F.R.E.S. will be first system to:
- Integrate high-power ultrasonic array (kW-scale) with liquid lithium at 400°C
- Demonstrate active acoustic stabilization in fusion-relevant environment
- Publish data on acoustic properties of liquid lithium at temperature
